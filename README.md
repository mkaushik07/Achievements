# Aterio.io Cost Savings Achievement

This repository contains documentation and evidence of the cost savings achieved at Aterio.io through the optimization of BigQuery code, which led to a reduction in Document AI API calls.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the impact of efficient data processing and query optimization in reducing operational costs. By refining the BigQuery code, we were able to minimize the number of Document AI API calls, resulting in significant cost savings for Aterio.io.

## Key Accomplishments

* **Optimized BigQuery Code:** Refactored and optimized BigQuery queries to reduce unnecessary data processing and API calls.
* **Reduced Document AI API Calls:** Successfully decreased the number of API calls, leading to a direct reduction in operational expenses.
* **Quantifiable Cost Savings:** Achieved a substantial cost reduction, lowering the cost of running a catalog process from $40 to $5. This demonstrates a direct and measurable improvement in operational efficiency.

## Methodology



1.  **Analysis:** Conducted a thorough analysis of existing BigQuery queries to identify inefficiencies and areas for optimization.
2.  **Refactoring:** Rewrote and optimized the queries to minimize data processing and API calls.
3.  **Testing:** Tested the optimized queries to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
4.  **Implementation:** Deployed the optimized queries to production.
5.  **Monitoring:** Continuously monitored API usage and cost savings.
